# What.CD :: Open all unread forum threads
The title says it all: this script opens all unread threads on a forum page in new tabs.

Based on an idea by horklinator.

## How it works
In any forum, you'll see a new link "Open all unread threads" (next to "New thread"). Clicking it will open all threads that have unread posts in new tabs. If you have read posts in that thread before, it will go directly to the last post you read (using the "Jump to last read" link), otherwise it will open the first page.
